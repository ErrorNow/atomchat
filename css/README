Edit __config.txt to add or remove CSS themes. Make sure it has no
trailing lines to prevent invalid options.

Each line must match the filename on disk, e.g. if your stylesheet is
called mytheme.css the line must read mytheme without the extension.
Then edit $ac_css_main = "mytheme" to set the new default.
