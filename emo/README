Icon filenames must match the associated primary keyword.

The default file type is set in $ac_emo_type.

Definitions of keywords, text smiles and variants are set in
__config.txt in the same folder containing the icons.

The default separator symbol is the vertical bar (pipe) | which must
not occur in either alternate, variant, or keyword spellings.

Create a subdirectoy in the emo folder, e.g. myemos, and place the icons
in that folder. Then edit $ac_emo_home = "myemos" to set myemos as the
new default.

Add the new set to __config.txt and make sure it has no trailing lines
to prevent invalid options.
