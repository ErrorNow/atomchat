Icon filenames must match the associated primary keyword. The default
file type is set in $ac_emo_type. Definitions of keywords, text smiles
and variants are stored in list.txt in the folder containing the icons.
The default separator symbol is the vertical bar | which must not occur
in either of the alternate, variant, or keyword spellings.

Create a subdirectoy in the emo folder, e.g. myemos, and place the icons
in that folder to add a new set. Then edit $ac_emo_home = "myemos" to
set myemos as the new default. Don't forget to keep a valid list.txt in
the folder and make sure there are no trailing lines at the end of the
file to prevent invalid options.

Despite having multiple icon sets, only one can be selected at any time.
Please note that a large list may considerably slow down the script.
