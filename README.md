# Atom Chat

**Free IRC like PHP chat script** with minimal bloat for low volume and personal sites.

- **What it is**
    - Completely anonymous. No passwords ever.
    - Self-contained set it and forget it.
    - Themeable responsive cross-browser design.
- **What it is not**
    - Fancy hyperbole gadget with more bells than whistles.
    - Resources leeching dependency stricken database voodoo.
    - Neither a pink jellyfish nor Santa on steroids.
- **How it works**
    - Enter preferred name and press the **Login** button.
    - Names are assigned dynamically. First come, first serve.
    - Inactive sessions are auto-closed after 30 minutes.
    - Auto-conversion of emojis without using a single image.
