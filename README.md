# Atom Chat

**Atom Chat** is a **free PHP chat script** with minimal bloat for low volume and personal sites.

Edit `$ac_dir` to set the script's folder and `$ac_max` to set the maximum characters allowed to post. User names are dynamically assigned without password, assuming a save environment of trusted users. Unauthorised access can easily be denied by placing the script in a restricted area. Pressing the optional Push button manually refreshes the log file if the browser doesn't support Java Script or for mere convenience.
