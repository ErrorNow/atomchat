Three easy steps to add a new translation


1.  Copy en.php and save as xx.php -- where xx is the language ID
    you are translating into, e.g. sv.php for Swedish.

    Visit https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry
    if you don't know the language ID.

    Always use the macro language, e.g. the sub tag for Mesopotamian
    Arabic is acm, so we use ar to indicate it's Arabic. 


2.  Open the new file in a text editor and update the reference, e.g.
    @language  Swedish -- Eric Son <eson@example.com>

    - Don't change any other @tags and keep the structure exactly AS IS.
    - Save the file as UTF-8 without BOM and Unix line endings.


3.  Translate the strings and submit a pull request to the repository.


If you are a native speaker of any of the existing languages and spot
an error, please report your suggestion to the repository, thank you.
