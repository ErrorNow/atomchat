CSS Themes
----------

Edit __config.txt in the css folder to add or remove themes and make
sure it doesn't contain any trailing lines to prevent orphan list items.

Each line must match the exact filename on disk without extension, e.g.
for a stylesheet named MyTheme.css, the corresponding line must read
MyTheme. You can make MyTheme the default per $ac_css_def = "MyTheme"


Emoji Table
-----------

Due to poor Unicode support outside of Firefox currently only a reduced
subset of emojis can be savely converted. In addition, the appearance of
the icons differs greatly between browsers and platforms. YMMV.

Should you decide to edit the definitions in emojis.txt, make sure the
file does not contain any trailing lines to prevent orphan list items.

A good starting point to check common icons and their Unicode values is
at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji -- though at least for the time
being only Firefox actually supports and renders them as expected.


Translations
------------

Make a copy of en.php in the lang folder and save it as xx.php, where
xx represents the language code identifier, e.g. fr for French, it for
Italian, and so on.

Visit https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php to lookup
your language code ID if you don't already know it.

Edit xx.php and mail a copy to @author given in en.php

Subject: Lang_XX_PHP_Atomchat
