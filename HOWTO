CSS Themes
----------

You can edit, add, or remove themes in the css folder.


Emoji Table

Due to poor Unicode support only a reduced subset can be savely
converted. Icons differ greatly between browsers and platforms.

Visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji to check common icons
and their Unicode values.
